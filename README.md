# Modal Window

This project is a very simple project that I learned from a JavaScript course. This project showcases some of the basic usage of Document Object Model (DOM) elements, including:

- `querySelector()` - Returns the *__first__* element that matches the class selectors
- `querySelectorAll()` - Returns *__all__* element that matches the class selectors
- `classList()` - This allows to manipulate class content attribute. Some of the common methods of `classList()`;  `add()`, `remove()`, `replace()`, and `toggle()`
- `addEventListener()` -  Sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target

**NOTE: DOM methods and properties are not part of JavaScript**

In this project I simply used these DOM methods to implement a modal window with a basic functionalities for a user to interact.
